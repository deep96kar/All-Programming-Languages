## How to Use This Folder

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/deep96kar/All-Programming-Languages.git
```

2. Browse examples:
- Open any `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use `Open with` in your editor).
- For examples that require a server (e.g., `fetch` from local files), run a simple local server. From the folder containing the HTML file you can use Python 3's http server:

```
# PowerShell (from the folder with the HTML file)
python -m http.server 8000; Start-Process http://localhost:8000
```

Or use Node.js `http-server` if installed:

```
npx http-server -c-1
```

3. Run Node examples (if a `.js` is intended for Node):

```
node path/to/file.js
```
